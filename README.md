# 🌸 Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** with **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV` on the famous **Iris dataset**. It also includes performance evaluation using a classification report and confusion matrix, along with visualizations.

## 🔍 Overview

- 🔬 Dataset: Iris (3 flower species - Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- 🧠 Model: Logistic Regression (multiclass)
- 🎯 Goal: Predict the class of flower based on sepal & petal measurements
- 🔧 Tuning: `C`, `penalty`, `solver`, `max_iter` using GridSearchCV

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Features

- GridSearchCV with cross-validation
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Automatic best model selection
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Accuracy vs Regularization (`C`) plot
